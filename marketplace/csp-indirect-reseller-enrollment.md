## Bundle Model

Two billing streams, one unified solution:

- **Microsoft licenses** (M365 + Copilot Studio) — billed through CSP via distributor
- **AgentRails SaaS** (governance, x402 payments) — billed through Microsoft Marketplace or direct

### What you sell to the customer:
1. M365 + Copilot Studio licenses (CSP)
2. Agent buildout and deployment (consulting — 2-week assessment)
3. Governance platform with RBAC, audit trails, kill switches (Enterprise license)
4. x402 payment infrastructure (SaaS)
5. Ongoing managed services (recurring)

## Indirect Reseller vs Direct Bill

| Dimension | Indirect Reseller | Direct Bill |
|---|---|---|
| Revenue requirement | $1,000 TTM (after 12 months) | $1,000,000 TTM |
| Prerequisite | None | 12+ months as indirect reseller |
| Solutions Partner | Not required | At least 1 required |
| Support plan | Not required | ASfP ($16,500/yr) or PSfP |
| Billing | Distributor handles | Direct with Microsoft |
| Margins | Lower (distributor cut) | Higher (direct wholesale) |
| API access | No (via distributor) | Yes (sandbox, provisioning) |
| Operational overhead | Low | High |
| Enrollment cost | Free | $16,500+/year |

**Indirect reseller is the right starting path.** Direct bill requires $1M CSP revenue and 12 months as indirect reseller first.

## Alternative Channel: ISV-to-CSP Private Offers

Since AgentRails already has a marketplace SaaS listing, existing CSP partners (distributors and direct bill partners) can purchase the AgentRails offer for their customers. This is a parallel motion — other CSP partners resell AgentRails without AgentRails needing to be a CSP reseller itself.
