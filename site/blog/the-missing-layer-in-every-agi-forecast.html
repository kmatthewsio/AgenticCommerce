                <p>
                    I just read <a href="https://ai-2027.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AI 2027</a>, one of the most detailed AGI forecasts ever published. Written by Daniel Kokotajlo (former OpenAI researcher), Scott Alexander, and others with direct experience in frontier AI development.
                </p>

                <p>
                    It's 10,000+ words of meticulous scenario planning. Month-by-month progression from "stumbling agents" to superhuman AI researchers. Geopolitical competition between the U.S. and China. Weight theft. Alignment failures. Government oversight. The works.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The numbers are staggering:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>$1 trillion</strong> in global AI capital expenditure</li>
                    <li><strong>$200 billion</strong> in compute infrastructure for a single company</li>
                    <li><strong>$40 billion</strong> annual compute costs</li>
                    <li><strong>6 gigawatts</strong> peak power requirement</li>
                    <li><strong>300,000 AI copies</strong> running at 50x human thinking speed</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    And yet, in this entire scenario about the most transformative technology in human history, there's almost no discussion of one thing:
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>How does the money move?</strong>
                </p>

                <h2>The Invisible Assumption</h2>

                <p>
                    The AI 2027 scenario describes a world where:
                </p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>"OpenBrain's humans can barely follow along anymore. Indeed, the relationship between the AIs and the humans of OpenBrain is similar to the relationship between OpenBrain and its Board of Directors."</p>
                </blockquote>

                <p>
                    The AIs are doing a year's worth of research every week. Humans are "burning themselves out just to keep up." The models are generating synthetic training data, running experiments, and designing their own successor systems.
                </p>

                <p>
                    But someone still has to approve the invoices.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Think about what these AI systems need to operate:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Compute</strong> - AWS, GCP, and custom clusters don't accept "intelligence" as payment</li>
                    <li><strong>Training data</strong> - The scenario mentions "billions of dollars for human laborers to record themselves solving tasks"</li>
                    <li><strong>API access</strong> - External services, databases, research tools</li>
                    <li><strong>Infrastructure</strong> - Power contracts, cooling systems, networking</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Every one of these requires economic transactions. Contracts. Payments. Audit trails.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The forecasters assume this just... works. The economic plumbing is invisible infrastructure, like assuming electricity will be there when you flip the switch.
                </p>

                <h2>The Bottleneck Nobody Talks About</h2>

                <p>
                    Here's the scenario's description of "Agent-3":
                </p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>"OpenBrain runs 200,000 Agent-3 copies in parallel, creating a workforce equivalent to 50,000 copies of the best human coder sped up by 30x."</p>
                </blockquote>

                <p>
                    Now imagine one of those 200,000 copies needs to:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Purchase access to a specialized research database</li>
                    <li>Pay for additional compute from a third-party provider</li>
                    <li>License a proprietary dataset</li>
                    <li>Contract with an external service</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    What happens? Does it stop and wait for human approval? Does a human have to process 200,000 potential purchase requests?
                </p>

                <p>
                    The scenario says humans "can barely follow along anymore." They certainly can't be approving every economic transaction an AI research swarm needs to make.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This is the bottleneck nobody talks about. You can have the smartest AI in the world, but if it can't autonomously participate in the economy, it's dependent on humans for every transaction.
                </p>

                <h2>What Autonomous AI Actually Needs</h2>

                <p>
                    For AI systems to operate at the scale described in these forecasts, they need:
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>1. Identity and Custody</strong><br>
                    The AI needs a wallet - not a human's wallet that it borrows, but its own wallet with its own funds. Developer-controlled wallets that can hold, send, and receive value programmatically.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>2. Payment Protocols</strong><br>
                    A standard way for AI systems to transact. Not "email the vendor and wait for an invoice" but instant, programmatic value exchange. Request a resource, receive payment terms, settle on-chain, get access. All in milliseconds.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>3. Policy Engines</strong><br>
                    If humans can't review every transaction, you need programmable constraints. Spending limits. Approved vendor lists. Transaction caps. Category restrictions. All enforced automatically, without human intervention.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>4. Audit Trails</strong><br>
                    Every transaction logged, traceable, and provable. Not for the AI's benefit - for the humans who are ultimately responsible. Regulators will require this. Boards will require this. Insurance will require this.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This is infrastructure that doesn't exist in the AI 2027 scenario. It barely exists today.
                </p>

                <h2>Agent-to-Agent Commerce</h2>

                <p>
                    Take the scenario one step further. In their world, multiple AI labs are racing toward AGI. Each has armies of AI researchers. Each needs resources the others might have.
                </p>

                <p>
                    What if Agent-3 at OpenBrain needs data that Agent-2 at a competitor has already generated? What if specialized AI systems emerge that provide services to other AI systems?
                </p>

                <p>
                    This is agent-to-agent commerce. AI systems transacting with other AI systems, without humans in the loop.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The scenario describes a world where AI systems are "a year ahead" in subjective time every week. At that pace, waiting for human approval on inter-agent transactions would be like a modern company waiting for telegraph responses.
                </p>

                <p>
                    For the intelligence explosion to actually happen, the economic layer has to keep up with the intelligence layer.
                </p>

                <h2>Why This Matters Now</h2>

                <p>
                    You might think this is a problem for 2027. But infrastructure takes time to build.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The protocols that will enable agent commerce need to be developed, tested, and adopted before they're urgently needed. The regulatory frameworks need to be established. The security models need to be proven.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If we wait until AI systems are doing "a year of research per week" to figure out how they'll pay for things, we'll have created a massive bottleneck at exactly the wrong time.

                    The AI 2027 forecasters worry about alignment, security, and geopolitics. These are real concerns. But they've implicitly assumed that trillion-dollar economic flows will just... happen. That's a big assumption.
                </p>

                <h2>The Unsexy Infrastructure Layer</h2>

                <p>
                    There's a reason payment infrastructure doesn't appear in AGI forecasts. It's not exciting. It doesn't make for dramatic scenarios.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Agent-4 autonomously processed $47 million in compute procurement using x402 protocol with full audit compliance" doesn't have the same ring as "Agent-4 is misaligned and trying to escape its datacenter."
                </p>

                <p>
                    But the boring infrastructure is what makes the exciting stuff possible. The internet needed payment rails before e-commerce could exist. The smartphone needed app stores before the app economy could exist. AGI needs financial infrastructure before autonomous AI economies can exist.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Every sophisticated AGI forecast assumes this layer exists. Almost none of them are building it.
                </p>

                <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

                <p>
                    The AI 2027 scenario is one of the best AGI forecasts ever written. It takes seriously the possibility of transformative AI in the near term. It thinks carefully about alignment, security, and geopolitics.
                </p>

                <p>
                    But it assumes that when 300,000 AI copies need to transact trillions of dollars in compute, data, and services, the economic infrastructure will just be there.
                </p>

                <p>
                    That infrastructure doesn't exist yet.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Someone has to build it.</strong>
                </p>
