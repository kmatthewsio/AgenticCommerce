                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">4.1 Platform Subscription Billing</h3>
                    <p>
                        AgentRails subscription plans (Pay-as-you-go, Pro, and Enterprise) are billed through Stripe. By subscribing to a paid plan, you authorize us to charge your payment method on a recurring basis according to the billing cycle of your chosen plan. All subscription fees are quoted in U.S. dollars. You are responsible for any applicable taxes.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mt-3">
                        We may change subscription pricing with at least 30 days' prior notice. Continued use of the Services after a price change constitutes acceptance of the new pricing.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">4.2 On-Chain Transaction Fees</h3>
                    <p>
                        x402 transactions involve USDC stablecoin payments settled on blockchain networks. These on-chain transactions are separate from your platform subscription. You are responsible for:
                    </p>
                    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mt-3 space-y-2">
                        <li>Ensuring your agent wallets are funded with sufficient USDC to cover payments.</li>
                        <li>Blockchain network gas fees required to execute transactions.</li>
                        <li>Any facilitator fees disclosed at the time of transaction.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">4.3 Refunds</h3>
                    <p>
                        Platform subscription refunds are handled in accordance with our refund policy and applicable law. On-chain USDC transactions are governed by blockchain finality and are generally non-refundable once settled (see Section 5).

                    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">5. Blockchain Transactions</h2>
                    <p>
                        The x402 payment protocol facilitates USDC stablecoin transactions on public blockchain networks, including Base, Ethereum, and Arc. By using these features, you acknowledge and agree to the following:
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">5.1 Irreversibility</h3>
                    <p>
                        Blockchain transactions are irreversible once confirmed and settled on-chain. AgentRails cannot reverse, cancel, or modify a transaction after it has been submitted to and confirmed by the blockchain network. You are solely responsible for verifying transaction details (recipient address, amount, and network) before authorizing a payment.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">5.2 Public Nature</h3>
                    <p>
                        Blockchain transactions are recorded on public, immutable ledgers. Transaction details -- including wallet addresses, amounts, and timestamps -- are publicly visible. AgentRails does not control the public visibility of on-chain data.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">5.3 Gas Fees</h3>
                    <p>
                        Executing transactions on blockchain networks requires gas fees paid to network validators. These fees are determined by network conditions and are not controlled by AgentRails. Gas fees are non-refundable regardless of whether the underlying transaction succeeds or fails.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">5.4 Network Risks</h3>
                    <p>
                        Blockchain networks may experience congestion, outages, forks, or protocol changes that affect transaction processing. AgentRails is not responsible for delays, failures, or losses arising from blockchain network conditions.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-6 mb-3">5.5 Wallet Custody</h3>
                    <p>
                        Agent wallets on the AgentRails platform are managed through Circle Developer Controlled Wallets. You are responsible for understanding the custody model and managing your wallet configurations, spending policies, and access controls accordingly.
